# Run The API
Run server for api application inside REAT project folder
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

# Run The Application
Run the myapp.py file seperately in a new terminal based on the action to perform, which will behave as an external application to communicate with our api
```bash
python myapp.py
```


NOTES: 

* Keep the server running while running the app.

* Superuser is created with below credentials to access the admin application(username-admin,password-admin).

* Please note the external application i.e. myapp.py can be improvised to a high extend incorporating authentication and authorization in order to filter which user has access to what data and the operations to be performed thereafter.
